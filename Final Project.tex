    \section*{Goals}

        The goal of this computational model is to enhance student understanding in a preclass activity for a given week. As such, it should be tailored to the learning goals of previous preclass activities. Using the current list of learning goals for week 7 magnatism in BPHYS122 as a reference, students should be able to:

        \begin{itemize}

            \item Describe similarities and differences between electric and magnetic fields
            \item Use a compass to identify the direction and relative magnitude of a magnetic field, and to identify the north pole of a bar magnet
            \item Draw and interpret magnetic field vectors and field lines: (1) in general, (2) for a bar magnet, (3) for a straight current-carrying wire, and (4) for a loop of current
            \item Calculate the magnetic force on (1) a charged particle moving in a magnetic field, and (2) on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field
            \item Explain how a charged particle in an external magnetic field undergoes circular motion, and find the radius of that motion
            \item Calculate the force on a current-carrying wire in an external magnetic field (magnitude and direction)
            \item Evaluate the net force on a current loop in an external magnetic field
            \item Evaluate the net torque on a current loop in an external magnetic field
            \item Define the magnetic dipole moment of a current loop

        \end{itemize}

        For this final project I will focus on creating a preliminary active learning activity with an integrated model that addresses goals 4a, and 5. This'll be far from comprehensive, but I'll discuss how
